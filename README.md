# Casio fx-CG50 Statistics Toolkit

This repository contains Python scripts and text-based programs designed for statistical analysis on the Casio fx-CG50 calculator.  
Ideal for students and educators, it offers ready-to-use tools that leverage the fx-CG50â€™s Python capabilities for common statistical tasks.

## Contents

- **[Python Files](./PythonFiles)**  
  Contains Python scripts (`.py`) that should be copied directly into the **main folder** of the calculator. These use the built-in Python interpreter of the fx-CG50.

- **[Program Casio fx CG50](./Program_Casio_fx_CG50)**  
  Contains Casio-specific programs in `.txt` and `.g3m` format. These should be copied into the `@MainMem\PROGRAM` directory of the calculator. Once transferred, they will appear under **Menu > Program**.

## Usage

1. Connect your Casio fx-CG50 calculator to your PC.
2. Copy the `.py` files from `PythonFiles/` to the root (main) folder of the calculator.
3. Copy the `.txt` or `.g3m` files from `Program_Casio_fx_CG50/` into `@MainMem\PROGRAM`.
4. Safely disconnect the calculator. The programs will then be accessible via **Menu > Program**.

This setup allows you to perform statistical computations efficiently using both Python and Casio's program interface.
